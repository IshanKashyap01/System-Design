# Denormalization

- It refers to flattening all the data into a single table

- To get results from multiple tables, we can use joins in RDBMS

- However, joins are very expensive operations and are not ideal for very large
amounts of data

- If the data is stored on multiple devices, joins become even slower

- Therefore, denormalization is a better solution for analytics
