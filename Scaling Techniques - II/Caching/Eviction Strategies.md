# Cache Eviction Strategies

These are used to add new data and remove old data from the cache

## First In First Out (FIFO)

It evicts the data in the order of insertion into the cache

## Last In First Out (LIFO)

It evicts the latest data added to the cache

## Least Recently Used (LIFO)

The data that was chronologically last used, is evicted first

## Most Recently Used (MRO)

It evicts the data the latest data used from the cache

## Random Replacement (RR)

Data is randomly picked for eviction without bias
