# Vertical Scaling

## Scaling an Application

- Once the system starts to reach maximum utilisation, we risk decreased load times

- The easiest way to scale up our app is to:

  - add more RAM and disk

  - upgrade the CPU to handle more computations

  - increase network bandwidth

- This form of scaling is known as **vertical scaling**

- Although, there is a limit to vertical scaling

## Limitations of Vertical Scaling

1. As we add more and more resources into a single system, we lead to a **Single**
**Point of Failure (SPOF)**

2. After a certain point, vertical scaling becomes *very expensive* leading to
*diminishing returns on investments*

3. Moreover, it cannot handle an *exponential increase in clients*
