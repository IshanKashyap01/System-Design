# Introduction

## Scalability

- An application is said to be scalable, iff *load has no effect on response times*

- That is, *response time* should remain *the same* as *load increases*

## Redundancy & Replication

- The phenomena of handling failure gracefully is known as **partition tolerance**

- Partitioning can happen due to *absence of n/w* or if a *system goes down*

- This is done by *replication and/or redundancy*
