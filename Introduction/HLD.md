# Types of System Design

## High Level System Design (HLD)

- It is the *overall design* of the whole application

- It briefly covers the *details of each component* of the application

- It is an *early step* of designing based on *requirements* and *scale estimations*

- HLD involves *both* functional and non-functional requirements

- *Architecture diagrams* are created during this process

- It is generally designed by *senior engineers and architects*

## Steps in High Level Design

1. Understanding the problem

2. Requirement analysis

    1. Functional requirements

    2. Non-functional requirements

3. Capacity Estimation (scale of application)

4. Defining components of the whole application and their communication
