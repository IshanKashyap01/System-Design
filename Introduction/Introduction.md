# Introduction to System Design

- It refers to the process of defining elements of a system and their interaction
with each other

- The elements include architecture, components, modules etc.

- A problem is broken down into smaller, manageable chunks

- This is all done to achieve business requirements

- There are two types of system design:

    1. High level system design

    2. Low level system design

## Importance of System Design

- System design considers all aspects of the application and creates an easy to
understand view

- This makes communication b/w technical and non-technical members (stakeholders,
management, developers etc.) easy and effective

- It also considers potential future requirements and changes, hence making system
more durable and flexible

- It provides big picture view on both system level and individual module levels

- Consequently, it leads to less failures, decreasing time and resource utilisation
in both design and implementation stages
