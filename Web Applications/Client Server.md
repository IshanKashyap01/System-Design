# Client-Server Architecture

- A web app is comprised of a front-end, a back-end and a data storage layer

- All interactions b/w the components happen over a network

- The application making a request over the n/w is called a client whereas the
responder is called a server

## Web Server vs Application Server

- A *web server* allows clients to view static files such as `HTML` and supports
the `http` protocol

- As such a web server does not have much support for multithreading and can only
serve web-based apps

- Whereas an *application server* allows access to web apps and supports multiple
protocols

- Moreover, it supports multi-threading and can serve web apps as well as enterprise
apps
