# Tier Architecture

- The application is divided into multiple layers/tiers where each layer builds
upon the previous one

- Data travels linearly i.e. each layer can only interact w/ its adjacent layers

- Each tier will have its separate logic and code

- The most common tier architecture is the **3 Tier Architecture** with:

    1. Web/Presentation layer

    2. Application layer

    3. Database layer
