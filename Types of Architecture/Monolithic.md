# Monolithic Architecture

- A monolithic architecture is a type of architecture where all components are
created as a single indivisible unit

- Here, all the code is written and deployed together as a single unit and cannot
be separated into smaller, independent parts

- Hence, the entire application is present on a single machine

## Advantages of Monolithic Architecture

1. When we are just starting and don't know what the future of our product could
be or have other limitations such as time, resources, experience, monolithic
cannot go wrong

2. When we have a latency sensitive system i.e. we cannot afford high response
times

3. It is relatively easier to serve monolithic systems

4. Integration is also easier as there are not many pieces

5. When developers are less experienced, monolithic is a safer option as it is
the most basic architecture that all developers know about

## Disadvantages of Monolithic Architecture

- Tight coupling leading to problems in maintainence and updations as changes in
one module can impact others

- Any change in one module will require redeployment of the entire system

- Less scalable as the entire system is contained in just one system

- Cannot use multiple tech stacks due to interdependence
