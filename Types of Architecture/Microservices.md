# Microservices Architecture

- In this architecture, the application is divided into many smaller, independent
applications called microservices

- Each of these microservices must follow the **single responsibility principle**

- The goal is to achieve **loose coupling**

- There are two categories of applications in microservices: **service requester**
and **service provider**

- Each service has its own database and has no direct linkage to other services

- Services interact with each other only via **Application Programming Interfaces**
**(APIs)** over a network

## Advantages of Microservices

- Selective scaling is very easy

- Loose coupling means low deployment and development times

- Free to use multiple tech stacks due to independence of individual services

- Proper ownership and better collaborations

## Disadvantages of Microservices

- Costly infrastructure

- Tricky integration testing

- Expensive and complex security

- Higher latency due to additional network usage

- Complex to develop and maintain
