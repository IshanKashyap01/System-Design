# Web Applications

- Web apps are basically websites with additional features and interactive elements

- Web apps typically contain a data storage layer in addition to the usual front
and back ends

- Front-end is for user interactions like inputs and outputs, which interacts
with the back-end

- Back-end is the business layer, which contains all the logic needed to express
data in the front-end

- While the data storage layer permanently stores all the information and interacts
with the back-end for storage and retrieval

## Websites vs Webapps

- Websites are those with static, non-interactable (read-only) content

- Some 5 to 10 years ago, websites were prevelant over the internet

- For ex. blogging websites, newspaper sites, Wikipedia etc.

- Web Applications on the other hand, are dynamic and interactable

- Most applications nowadays are web applications rather than downloadable mobile
or desktop apps

- Even many apps on various app stores have their own web app as well

- In fact, most businesses nowadays start with a web app rather than a traditional
desktop or mobile application

- For ex. facebook.com, gmail.com, linkedin.com etc.
