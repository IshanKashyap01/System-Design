# Availability

- An application is said to be *highly* available if it *responds back* all the
time i.e. is *won't be unreachable*

- The response could be an expected outcome or an error message

## Availability Based on Architecture

- *Monolithic* systems have a *single point of failure* leading to *low* availability

- While distributed systems have more servers leading to *high* availability
due to *redundancy and replication*

## How to Improve Availability

- *High* **fault tolerance** leads to *high* availability, which can be achieved
by *redundancy and replication*

- Reduce the **downtime/fix time**

- Proper and pro-active monitoring and altering
