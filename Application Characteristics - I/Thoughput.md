# Throughput

- **Throughput** refers to the amount of requests a system can serve at once

- For ex. if a server can serve 50 requests per second, then this is its throughput

- Hence, it is the *amount of work* that can be done in *parallel* in *unit time*

- It is sometimes also referred as *transactions per second*

- *High* throughput can hence, improve *latency* of the system

## Throughput based on Architecture

- Throughput in a *monolithic* system will always be *limited/fixed*

- While *distributed systems* have **no upper limit**

- Hence, distributed systems are chosen for *high throughput requirements*

## How to Improve Throughput

- It can be achieved by improving machine resources

- Just like latency, *CDN and caching* can also help increase throughput

- Proper monitoring and bug fixing performance issues and bottlenecks

- Distributed systems with load balancing
