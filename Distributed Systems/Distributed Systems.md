# Distributed Systems

- Distributed systems solve problems (whether storage or computational) that cannot
be solved by a single machine

- Here, all the machines interact w/ each other via a network

- Although, to the user, it still *appears* as a single system

## Principles of Distributed Systems

- Always make use of *commodity h/w* i.e. economic, interchangeable machines

- *Proper communication channels* i.e. network plays a very important role

## Advantages

- High *reliability* as there's no single point of failure

- *Low latency* as there are multiple servers close to target users

- *Highly scalable* as machines are independent of each other

## Disadvantages

- High number of devices make *synchronisation* and *data integrity* challenging

- *N/w failure* can cause conflicting information or communication failures

- Increase in n/w points and devices increases *complexity* of the whole system

- Maintainence requires *constant* load balancing, monitoring, and logging to prevent
failures
