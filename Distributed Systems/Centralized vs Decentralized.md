# Centralized vs Decentralized Applications

- If a single entity or a group of entities own the whole application,
such a system is called a **centralized application**

- The flow of data is from a single source be it a dedicated server or a cluster

- For example, Meta has full control of FB and its servers

- While **decentralized applications** has distributed control and no central
authority

- For example, blockchain technology, Bit Torrent etc.
