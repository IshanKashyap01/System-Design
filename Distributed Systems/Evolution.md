# Evolution of Distributed Systems

- Back in the early 2000s, the idea of distributed systems became famous and everyone
was excited about it

- Companies like IBM, Microsoft and Google heavily invested in them

- However, they failed miserably because they started losing data and went back
to centralized systems like Oracle's

- Although, Google persisted and realised the two problems of distributed systems

- Due to commodity h/w along with n/w issues failure chances were very high as
both were very unreliable

- The engineers at Google came up with a solution: **redundancy**

- They **replicated** the data on multiple system solving their biggest problem:
losing data

- Then, they came up with the **Google File System (GFS)** as a storage solution
for distributed storage

- And **MapReduce** for distributed computation
