# Proxies

- A proxy is a decoy object that stands in place of the real object

## Forward Proxy

- A proxy server makes requests to the server on behalf of the client

- The server sees the proxy as the client and has no knowledge of the real client

## Reverse Proxy

- The proxy server serves requests of the clients on behalf of the server

- The client sees the proxy as the server and has no knowledge of the real server

- It prevents exposure of the server to the clients and ensures safety

- It hides the complexity of the server and makes communication simple

- `API Gateways` and `CDN` are an example of reverse proxies
