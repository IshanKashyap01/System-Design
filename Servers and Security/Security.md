# Application Security

- Applications ensures security for both themselves and their users by:

    1. `Authentication`: Requires the users to prove their identity before they
    are allowed to connect

    2. `Authorization`: Enforces the rights/privileges of the users granted by
    the application

## Basic Authentication

- The client completes a registration process and gets a login/pass to access the
application

- Every time the client needs to make a request, this login/pass is also sent
alongside it

- However, it exposed the private credentials of the users over the network

## Access Token-Based Authentication

- The user is first registered into the system and provided some credentials

- A login process is completed that generates an `access token` for the client

- Every time the client makes a request, this token is sent with it

## OAuth (Open Authentication)

- In `OAuth`, the authorization is delegated to some other common and trusted entity

- For example, many sites and apps allows users to login via Google

- The app has to first onboard itself over these information providers

- It allows for multi-factor authentication and is the most preferred option for
authentication

- An authorization token is generated by the information provider for the app

- Therefore, eliminating the need for a password by the user
